    Problem Statement #
    Given an array containing 0s, 1s and 2s, sort the array in-place.
    You should treat numbers of the array as objects,
    hence, we canâ€™t count 0s, 1s, and 2s to recreate the array.

    The flag of the Netherlands consists of three colors: red, white and blue;
    and since our input array also consists of three different numbers that is
    why it is called Dutch National Flag problem.


    Example 1:
    Input: [1, 0, 2, 1, 0]
    Output: [0 0 1 1 2]
        *
    0   0   1   1   2
            ^
    Example 2:
    Input: [2, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0]
    Output: [0 0 1 2 2 2 ]
